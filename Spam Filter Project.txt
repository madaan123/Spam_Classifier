Step 1 :- Make a dictionary of words that the computer wishes to know in order to process the emails.
Extract all the words in a list of words and remove the duplcates and non alphanumeric words
Enclose all this task into a function

Step 2 :- Prepare the dataset
We will be using a supervised machine learning model
We will build a feature vector which is a mathematical way of representing a string.
Build a feature vector for every email and then append it to the feature set
Then label the feature vector according to the type of email that it is.

Step 3 :- Training the model with the feature set
we have used the naives bayes approach for our machine learning model
from sklearn library import multinomialNB
we will break our feature set into training and testing set by train and test split function
we will train our model on training set and then we will measure our accuracy
To measure the accuracy we will use accuracy_score function from sklearn.metrics
we will save our machine learning model and then we will test it on the new email that we will enter as raw text
we will take raw file as input and then convert it into feature vector and then apply our classification process on it.
We will then be able to predict whether it is spam or not spam
